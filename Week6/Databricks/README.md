### General Observations and Comments:
- Koalas syntax is very similar to Pandas
- Databricks "Clusters":
    - A Databricks cluster is a set of computation resources and configurations on which you run data engineering, data science, and data analytics workloads, such as production ETL pipelines, streaming analytics, ad-hoc analytics, and machine learning.
    - You run these workloads as a set of commands in a notebook or as an automated job. Databricks makes a distinction between all-purpose clusters and job clusters. You use all-purpose clusters to analyze data collaboratively using interactive notebooks. You use job clusters to run fast and robust automated jobs.
    - It seems that clusters need to be reinitiated every time you log in to Databricks...?
